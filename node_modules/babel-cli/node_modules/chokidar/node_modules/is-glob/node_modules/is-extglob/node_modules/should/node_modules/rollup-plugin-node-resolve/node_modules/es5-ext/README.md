# es5-ext
## ECMAScript 5 extensions
### (with respect to ECMAScript 6 standard)

Shims for upcoming ES6 standard and other goodies implemented strictly with ECMAScript conventions in mind.

It's designed to be used in compliant ECMAScript 5 or ECMAScript 6 environments. Older environments are not supported, although most of the features should work with correct ECMAScript 5 shim on board.

When used in ECMAScript 6 environment, native implementation (if valid) takes precedence over shims.
